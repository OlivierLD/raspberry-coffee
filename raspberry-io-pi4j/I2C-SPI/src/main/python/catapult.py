# These are libraries.  They are code written by other people that we're re-using to make our life easier.
# Importing them lets the computer know we're going to be using them.  Without them this code won't work.
# The RPi.GPIO library controls the pins we hooked up our servo to.
# the time library us used to let us delay parts of the program from running.
# the random library lets us launch different distances to solve for pi.

# Here we're setting up our variables.  Ideally you want to only change things in one place, and have it work.
# That's why we've set up these variables.  We then re-use the variables throughout the code to make life easy.
# ServoPin is where we've connected the servo.  You can use any GPIO pin if you prefer
# Duty cycle high - this is how many milliseconds your servo says is for 90 degrees up.  Ours is actually 1.5,
#    but I'll explain why I'm using 1.4 in the instructable.
# Duty cycle low is where your servo is parallel with the ground.  You can actually use 180 degree's or 0.
#    again, this is in milliseconds per your manufacturer's spec sheet.
# Period.  This is how long between pulses on your spec sheet.  Ours is 20 milliseconds.
# TimeHigh.  You can have your arm go quickly back down, or wait at the top.  I'll explain my time on instructables
# TimeLow.  This is how long you think you'll want for reloading.
