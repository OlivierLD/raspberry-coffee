## I2C Arduino
Shows how to use an Arduino as an I2C Slave.
See the code - in this project - at `RPi_I2C/RPi_I2C.ino`

`i2c.comm.Arduino.java` shows the basics, `i2c.comm.I2CArduino.java` shows something a bit more elaborated,
with a tiny communication protocol between the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi.
