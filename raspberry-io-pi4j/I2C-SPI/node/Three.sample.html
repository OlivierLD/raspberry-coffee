    // create the cube with dimensions 1x1x1 with MeshBasicMaterial (one of many materials available in three.js.

    // At this point, both the camera and the cube are at co-ordinates (0,0,0) or the origin.
    // So the cube isn't visible yet. Hence, we move the camera towards 5 units along the +ve direction in z-axis.

    // Similar to the cube, here we create a sphere.
    // The THREE.SphereGeometry method takes 4 arguments.
    // 1. radius - sets the radius of the sphere.
    // 2. segmentsWidth - increasing this will result in a smoother sphere at the cost of performance.

    // The cylinder is created in this section.

    // The first is for the upper radius, the second is for the lower radius.
    // For a cylinder, we want the top and bottom radius to have the same set of values.
    // The third and fourth arguments are height and segments respectively.
    // Increasing these lead to a smoother cylinder at the cost of performance. Lowering
    // these values is useful for giving "sides" to the cylinder. We'll use this idea in creating a pyramid later.

    scene.add(cylinder);


    // Alright, so here we create a cone. But we'll again be using the methods used to create a cylinder.
    // That's because a cone is essentially a cylinder with it's top radius set to 0.
    // So, just as before we make the cone (but with top radius = 0) and position it 4 units to the right of the cube.

    // We make use of the segments parameter to set the sides to 4.
    var pyramidgeometry = new THREE.CylinderGeometry(0, 0.8, 2, 4, false);
    var pyramidmaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({wireframe: true, color: 0x000000});
