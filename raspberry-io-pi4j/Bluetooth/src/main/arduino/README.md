Arduino language reference [here](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/).

There is a cool on-line Arduino (and others) simulator on [Tinkercad](http://www.tinkercad.com).

- Log in using a gmail account.
- Choose "Circuits"
- Then "Create new Circuit"
- In the top-right search box, look for "Arduino"
- Drag a "Arduino Uno R3" on the empty center pane
- Click the "Code" button in the toolbar (on the right)

... And you're good to go! You even have a cool [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly) option.

Look at [that one](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/7RGhSjmQfOj-morse-generator), the online version of the Morse code generator.

The BLE Part is a Work In Progress...
