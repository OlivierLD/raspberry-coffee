## Summary of the Python scripts
- `sample.05.1.py`
    - Will use images from the training data set to evaluate the digits it represents
- `sample.05.2.py`
    - Similar to `sample.05.1.py`, but with YOUR own images.
    - Model `training.h5` must already exist
    - Uses OpenCV to reshape the images as expected by the model
- `sample.05.2.save.py`
- `sample.05.3.py`
    - Synopsis:
        - Enter digit images to compose number A
        - Enter operation (+, -, *, /)
        - Enter digit images to compose number B
        - Enter = to get the result
    - Model `training.h5` must already exist
    - Use images from training or test dataset.
- `sample.05.21.py`
    - Similar to `sample.05.1.py`, but with YOUR own images, read from the camera.
    - Model `training.h5` must already exist
    - Uses OpenCV to reshape the images as expected by the model
        - SHOW AN HAND-WRITTEN CHARACTER TO THE CAMERA
        - HIT 'S' TO HAVE IT RECOGNIZED
- `convnet/sample.01.py`
    - Digits recognition, Model training with a Convolutional Network (aka convnet)
    - Model can be saved from here too.
- `sample.06.py`
    - Images recognition, like dresses, shirts, shoes, etc.
- `python.scratch/several_digits.py`
    - Splitting a multi-digit hand-written number into specific characters (for recognition)
