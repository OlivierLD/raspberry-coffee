# Deviation Curve
Here is a graphical tool allowing you to elaborate your own deviation curve from logged data.

## How it works
The generic format of a deviation curve is
```
dev(Z) = a + (b . sin(Z)) + (c . cos(Z)) + (d . sin(2.Z)) + (e . cos(2.Z))
```
where `Z` is the Magnetic Heading (`HDM`).

All we need is to come up with the coefficients `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` and `e`.

From a log file, we need to extract the Course Over Ground (`COG`) and the Magnetic Heading (`HDM`), which is the
Compass Heading (`HDG`) corrected with the Magnetic Declination (`D`).

```
 HDM = HDG + D
```

Then for each `HDM`, we establish the difference with `COG`, so we end up with `n` tuples
like `(Z, diff)`, representing a cloud of points.

We will use the [Least Square method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares) to come up with the expected coefficients.

> For details on the Least Square method, for this specific case, see [this document](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/OlivierLD/raspberry-coffee/blob/master/Project.Trunk/Deviation.Tool/README.html).

For each point, for each `HDM`, we want the calculated deviation to be as close as possible to the measured deviation.

To get rid of the sign, we will use the square of the difference.

What will want then becomes:
For each point, for each `HDM`, we want the square of the difference between calculated and measured deviations to be as small as possible.

This means that the first derivative of the function expressing this difference has to be equal to zero.

We will have a dimension 5 square matrix, and a dimension 1 array of 5 coefficients.

in the system above, `r` is the heading, `d` is the deviation (&delta; between `HDG` and `HDM`).

### The log file
We need at least `HDG` and `RMC`
```
$IIHDG,126,,,10,E*16
...
$IIRMC,190402,A,0854.980,S,14006.028,W,00.0,008,031110,10,E,A*07
```

The specification of HDG is the following one:
```
 $xxHDG,x.x,x.x,a,x.x,a*hh
        |   |   | |   | |
        |   |   | |   | Checksum
        |   |   | |   Magnetic Variation direction, E = Easterly, W = Westerly
        |   |   | Magnetic Variation degrees
        |   |   Magnetic Deviation direction, E = Easterly, W = Westerly
        |   Magnetic Deviation, degrees
        Magnetic Sensor heading in degrees
```

The specification of RMC is the following one:
```
         1      2 3        4 5         6 7     8     9      10    11
  $xxRMC,123519,A,4807.038,N,01131.000,E,022.4,084.4,230394,003.1,W*6A
         |      | |        | |         | |     |     |      |     |
         |      | |        | |         | |     |     |      |     Variation sign
         |      | |        | |         | |     |     |      Variation value
         |      | |        | |         | |     |     Date DDMMYY
         |      | |        | |         | |     COG
         |      | |        | |         | SOG
         |      | |        | |         Longitude Sign
         |      | |        | Longitude Value
         |      | |        Latitude Sign
         |      | Latitude value
         |      Active or Void
         UTC

```

Notice that the `HDM` and `RMC` sentences _may_ return the Variation (`W` equals to `D + d`).
In the samples above, this is obviously only the Magnetic Declination (`D`).

### Example
The data file provided here as an example was done motoring in an anchorage, in [Taiohae, Nuku-Hiva](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1ZbZm1G1fODnCzGFsiip7Hf2SFc_gNRzX&ll=-8.917066504857377%2C-140.0999415&z=18).
Those data are raw NMEA Data.

This sample data file is not ideal, the boat's path should be as round as possible, to have data on 360&deg;.
The circle (the path) should be as big as possible, to allow the COG to be in sync with the HDG.

But again, this is just an example, showing how to use the tool this document is about.

#### This gives the Compass' Deviation for any <u>Compass Heading</u>.
To use it:
- Read the Compass Heading (`HDC`)
- With the chart below, find the compass deviation `d` and add it to `HDC` to get the Magnetic Heading `HDM`.
- Then, to get the True Heading (`HDT`) you need to add the Magnetic Declination `D` from `HDM`.
```
W = D + d
HDT = HDC + W
```
In the above, `W` is called the Compass Variation

> Example:
- You read `HDC = 61°`
- The chart below returns a `d` of `5.4°E` (ie `+5.4°`)
- The Mag. Decl. is `10°E` (ie `+10°`)
- Then we have `HDM = 61 + 5.4 = 66.4°`
- And `HDT = HDM + 10 = 76.4°` 

> _Important_: You need to know what your GPS or NMEA is returning for the heading. It may depend on your station. Many return an `HDG` string
> for the Compass Heading (like in the sample data provided here).

> The RMC and HDM strings may return a field named Variation, that in many cases contains only the Mag. Decl.

#### Step by step
- After  running a build (`../../gradlew clean shadowJar`), transform the NMEA data file into a json document:
  - run `./process.log.sh 2010-11-03.Taiohae.nmea`, this generates a `data.json` (default name).
- Open `deviation.tool.html` in a browser (it does not need a server to run).
- Paste the content of the `data.json` in the top text box
- Click the [`Compute & Display`] button
- See the curve, along with its coefficients, and a generated `CSV` file content.

![The curve](./screenshot.01.png)

The blue line is showing the `dev` on `Compass Headings` (HDG + D + d).  
The cyan line is showing the `dev` on `Magnetic Headings` (HDG + D).

The two top-right boxes contain the `csv` values to put in the files holding the deviation curves. This content is to be copied and pasted.

> - You use `dev on Compass Headings` to get the True Heading from the Compass Heading (from the cockpit to the chart table).
> - You use `dev on Magnetic Headings` to get the Compass Heading from the True Heading (from the chart table to the cockpit).
