# SunFlower Versions 2.0 a and b, and more
![Work In Progress](./wip.jpg) 

The goal of this project is to _**automatically**_ orient a solar panel so it faces the sun as long as it is in the sky.

---
> _Preamble_:
> 
> I started from  [this instructable](https://www.instructables.com/id/Ammo-Can-Solar-Power-Supply/), showing how to load a small (15Ah) portable battery
> with a small solar panel.
>
> Obviously, orienting the panel so it faces the Sun improves the efficiency, a lot.
>
> The hardware described and used here can be 3D printed with the files generated by 
> the projects featured [here](https://github.com/OlivierLD/3DPrinting/tree/master/OpenSCAD/SolarPanelStand) and [here](https://github.com/OlivierLD/3DPrinting/tree/master/OpenSCAD/SolarPanelStand.v3). 
---

- The [first version](../SunFlower) used micro-servos to orient a small solar panel.
- Here we want to deal with bigger panels, this will require the usage of bigger motors, like stepper-motors.
- The required hardware is described in a [separate project](https://github.com/OlivierLD/3DPrinting/tree/master/OpenSCAD/SolarPanelStand).
- Stepper motors will be driven by an [Adafruit Motor Hat](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2348).
- Some code to look at is in [this folder](../SteppersPlayground), to play with the different options
of the stepper motors...

> Note: The position of the Sun is _**not** observed_ (from a photocell or any such sensor), it is _calculated_, from the 
> current position and time. See the `AstroComputer` class for details.
> As a result, even with an overcast sky, the device _will_ still face the Sun, and _yes_, it **does** make a difference.  

### Wiring
![Wiring](./MotorHatWiring.png)

> Note: It is also possible to power the `Motor Hat` from a USB port of the Raspberry Pi.
> This way, only one power supply is required, it's the usual 5v for the Raspberry Pi. 

### Standard output
Simple standard output, just run `run.sh`.

#### With the `calibration` option
Takes its input from the Command Line Interface (CLI), not from the Astro Thread. Use it to calibrate the device,
to make sure it is working as expected.
```
$ ./run.sh 
Starting SunFlowerDriver
------------------------------ C A L I B R A T I O N ----------------------------
To change the Azimuth (Z) value, enter 'Z=12.34', the value goes from 0 to 360.
To change the Elevation (E) value, enter 'E=23.45', the values goes from 0 to 90.
Enter 'PARK' to park the device.
Enter 'Q' to quit.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Current status: Z=180.00, Elev.=90.00
> z=213
Current status: Z=213.00, Elev.=90.00
> 
. . .
``` 
 
### ANSI Console output
This console is designed not to run in background mode (see `SunFlowerServer` for that), it orients the panel, as it displays the
orientation parameters.

Run `sunflower.main.ConsoleMain`, from the script `console.sh`.

### Date Simulation
The default date used for Celestial Computation is the current system date.

For development or demo, there is a possibility to simulate this date.

To simulate the date, you need to provide three system variables:
- `-Ddate.simulation=true`. default `false`
- `-Dstart.date.simulation=2020-03-06T20:00:00`. Duration Format. no default. Must be provided if `date.simulation` is `true`.
- `-Dincrement.per.second=600`. In seconds, no default, minimum `1`. Must be provided if `date.simulation` is `true`. Here - for example, this will increment the date by 10 minutes (600 seconds) every second.

### Heading input
If the device has to be carried by a vehicle in motion, we need to have the heading of the device.

Small magnetometers like an `HMC5883L` or an `LSM303` can do the job.
> _Note_: Those magnetometers **do require** a calibration, See [here](../../I2C.SPI/lsm303.calibration/README.md) for details. 
 
But the magnetometers can go crazy if they're too close to a magnet, and stepper motors heavily use magnets.

Having the magnetometer too close to the stepper motors is **not** a good idea.

This is where we use the `NMEA.multiplexer` project (part of this repo). We have another Raspberry Pi (a Raspberry Pi Zero does the job)
with a magnetometer attached to it, running the `NMEA.multiplexer`.
The `NMEA.multiplexer` can also serve as a REST server, storing NMEA data in a cache, queryable from a REST client.

|       HMC5883L                 |     HMC5883L                   |
|:------------------------------:|:------------------------------:|
| ![One](./pictures/mag.one.jpg) | ![Two](./pictures/mag.two.jpg) | 

> `STL` files for the gimbal can be found [here](https://github.com/OlivierLD/3DPrinting/tree/master/OpenSCAD/Gimbal).

#### Pulling Heading data
And this is what we do here, we've added two System properties:
```bash
JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Dping.nmea.server=true"
JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Dnmea.server.base.url=http://192.168.42.20:9991"
``` 
This tells the code driving the device to ping the NMEA server every second to get the heading from it.
In this case, it will do a REST request like 
```
GET http://192.168.42.20:9991/mux/cache
``` 
returning a `json` payload like
```json
{
    "NMEA_AS_IS": {
        "HDM": "$IIHDM,172,M*38",
        "XDR": "$IIXDR,A,178,D,PTCH,A,-160,D,ROLL*78"
    },
    "Damping": 1,
    "Current calculated with damping": {},
    "HDG Offset": 0.0,
    "Default Declination": {
        "angle": 14.0
    },
    "Deviation file name": "zero-deviation.csv",
    "HDG mag.": {
        "angle": 172.0
    },
    "BSP Factor": 1.0,
    "Max Leeway": 0.0,
    "AWS Factor": 1.0,
    "AWA Offset": 0.0,
    "NMEA": "$IIXDR,A,178,D,PTCH,A,-160,D,ROLL*78"
}
```
from which the heading is obtained, and used to calculate the azimuthal orientation of the panel. 
> See the `NMEADataThread`, in `FeatureRequestManager`.

#### Pushing
Instead of pulling the heading from wherever it is available, we could also use a push architecture.

In the `NMEA.multiplexer` project (part of this repo), there is this notion of `forwarder` that could be used here.
This project could be implement the `forwarder` interface, and the `NMEA.multiplexer` could push
the required data to the `SunFlowerDriver` (Position & Heading), from the server, to the SunFlower.
> For inspiration, see the existing forwarder `nmea.forwarders.SolarPanelOrienter`, designed to work
> with the `SunFlower.v1`, the one working with micro-servos.

### The Device
The software of this project is designed to drive [this sort of device](https://github.com/OlivierLD/3DPrinting/blob/master/OpenSCAD/SolarPanelStand.v2/stl/the.full.stand.stuck.stl).
Its 3D printing construction is detailed in [its repo](https://github.com/OlivierLD/3DPrinting/tree/master/OpenSCAD/SolarPanelStand.v2).

> Note: This project keeps track of several versions of the project, with external worm gear, with internal bevel gears,
> internal worm gear..., along with the lessons learned in each step.
> All versions are available here, with the appropriate comments.
> 
> This document will provide (some time soon) a list of all that.

#### The _real_ device
Here is a animation - stop motion - of the real device (first prototype), on 231 minutes, starting before noon, ending after. Event if the sky was obviously not clear, 
orienting the panel does make a difference on the load. The first frames are too bright, it **was** sunny... 😎

![Stop Motion](./stop.motion.gif)

In this animation - just to validate the concept, the Raspberry Pi driving the device, and the one taking the snapshots were both powered by the battery fed by the solar panel.

### Notes
- For the Motor HAT power supply, 5V is enough. Not need for 12V, and the motors seem to heat up with 12V.

### Bonus
The two versions, working together:
> Note: Below is the version 3, with a bevel gear instead of the worm gear.

![2 versions](./pictures/Two.Sun.Flower.jpg)

## TODO
- An ANSI Console. &#9989; &nbsp;Done (...ish).
- A Web Console. WiP.
    - REST and/or WebSockets?
- A utility, to manually/interactively orient the panel from user's inputs. &#9989; &nbsp;Done.
- A `forwarder` for the `NMEA.multiplexer`, as in `SolarPanelOrienter`.
    - This would allow Heading input, position input.
- Small OLED screen for position and orientation data.    

## Subsequent versions
> Mostly Hardware versions.   

### Challenges
- With V2 (details [here](https://github.com/OlivierLD/3DPrinting/tree/master/OpenSCAD/SolarPanelStand.v2))
    - Aligning the worm gear axis with its pinion was not obvious. 
    - Moved to V3, with a beveled gear
- With V3 (See [here](https://github.com/OlivierLD/3DPrinting/tree/master/OpenSCAD/SunFlower/SolarPanelStand.v3) and [here](https://github.com/OlivierLD/3DPrinting/tree/master/OpenSCAD/SunFlower/SolarPanelStand.v3/stl))
    - The beveled gear pinion (3D printed, in PLA) was hard to lock in place. Some skating happens on the axis from time to time.
    - ![pinion](./pictures/bevel.pinion.jpg)
    - Moved to V4, with a short worm gear
- With V4 (See [here](https://github.com/OlivierLD/3DPrinting/tree/master/OpenSCAD/SunFlower/SolarPanelStand.v4) and [here](https://github.com/OlivierLD/3DPrinting/tree/master/OpenSCAD/SunFlower/SolarPanelStand.v4/stl))
    - Like above, gear hard to align correctly
    - Moved to V5 ([here](https://github.com/OlivierLD/3DPrinting/tree/master/OpenSCAD/SunFlower/SolarPanelStand.v5))
- V5 (current version, see [here](https://github.com/OlivierLD/3DPrinting/tree/master/OpenSCAD/SunFlower/SolarPanelStand.v5/stl)) 
    - All metallic gears (16 teeth for the pinion, 76 for the wheel gear)
    - Vertical axis for the Azimuth motor
    - Good results so far (July-2020)
