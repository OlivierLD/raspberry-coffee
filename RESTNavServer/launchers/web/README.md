# Preamble
The files contained in this folder do not intend to be more than examples!  
Again: _**examples**_. Bring them to prod at your own risks.  
This is open source. You need to know what you're doing. You would not give a gun to an idiot, would you?

## TODO
- Web-Component console, with mirror/starwars effect for HeadsUp display, with at least (to begin with):
    - TWS, TWD
    - BSP (+ log), HDG
    - GPS Time (watch)
    - World Map
    - Analog AW

Done. See in the WebComponents folder. &#9989;

----

Expose the "Smooth-Move" (Also see previous `animate`) parameters at the component level for
- Analog Diplay
- Direction Display
- Compass Display
- Compass Rose
- Wind Angle Display (not there yet)

Add current and tws evolution in `webcomponents/console.html` (as in `web/console.html`).  
Upgrade the check boxes to rocking toggles.  
Move to arrow functions where possible.
