# Populate a database for Tide Computation
## For `sqlite`
- From the `sql` directory run the following command
  - `./install.sh`

It will unzip the `sql.zip` archive, and use the scripts it contains to 
create the DB tables and populate them.  
The sqlite database to use after that will be `tides.db`.
