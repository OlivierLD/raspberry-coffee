## ðŸŒŠ Tide Engine
### In Java

The XML engine is based on XML data, stored in `xml.zip`. Those data are generated after the
harmonic data files found in the `harmonics` directory.
Re-generating those coefficients is not necessary, but in case you're interested, run
```bash
 $ ../gradlew harmonicsXML
```
The sources of the generator are obviously available.

### Why are we using XML instead of the raw `txt` file?
The format of the harmonic files is a proprietary format. To be used efficiently, the file has to
be parsed and loaded in memory for the data it contains to be available in a timely manner.

This could be quite demanding for a small machine like the Raspberry Pi (the`Zero` has "only" 512 Mb of RAM), even the generation of the XML files
can be challenging for the Raspberry Pi.

Using a SAX Parser allows the amount of required memory to substantially shrink.
As opposed to a DOM Parser that loads the DOM representation of the document in memory,
the SAX parser scans it until the expected data are found.

> Note about the encoding: The XML Data are `ISO-8859-1` encoded.  
> For an easier access, those elements (mainly the String elements, like station names) are returned as `UTF-8` encoded data by REST APIs.

Some basic tests are available in the `tests` folder.
