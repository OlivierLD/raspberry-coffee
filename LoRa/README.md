# LoRa (Long Range)
Shows how to use an RFM95W Lora Radio module

This board has a SPI interface, the code in this directory could belong to the `I2C-SPI` project, but the intention was to also provide the code for the Arduino Uno.

I found the code I started from on the [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3072) website.


## Arduino to Arduino
The two sketches require the same wiring:

![RX TX](./RFM95_Arduino_bb.png)

You need two Arduinos: 
- one to transmit 
- one to receive.



## Raspberry Pi (Tx) and Arduino (Rx)
TODO

## Next
The same, on a Raspberry Pi, in Java. _That_ is a project...


## Another option
Serial communication between the Raspberry Pi and the Arduino.

The Raspberry Pi can communicate with the Arduino through a Serial Port.
Just use a USB A-B cable. The Serial port would usually be seen as `/dev/ttyACM0`.

> In case you have problem reading `/dev/ttyACM0`, create a symbolic link
> ```bash
> $ sudo ln -s /dev/ttyACM0 /dev/ttyS80
> ```
> Then try reading or writing on /dev/ttyS80
>
> To unlink:
> ```bash
> $ sudo unlink /dev/ttyS80
> ```

To use this pattern, see the classes in the package `arduino`, and the sketches `ArduinoRF95_RX` and `ArduinoRF95_TX`.
The scripts `runArduinoComm.sh` and `runArduinoServer.sh` go along with those classes.

#### Next
Tests on the range of the LoRa.

### Example

### To build
```bash
 $ cd LoRa
 $ git pull origin master
 $ ../gradlew [--no-daemon] shadowJar
```

#### UseCase: Broadcast NMEA Data
Using the NMEA Multiplexer, based on its structure, we've written a `LoRaPublisher`.

On one Raspberry Pi (emitter, #**1**), where the NMEAMultiplexer reads NMEA Data (from a GPS, a log file, etc),
there is also an Arduino with a `LoRa` connected to it, with `ArduinoRF95_TX` running on it.

On another machine, Raspberry PI or not (receiver, #**2**), with an Arduino running `ArduinoRF95_RX` connected to it, run the script
named `runArduinoServer.sh` (this script invokes the java class `arduino.ArduinoLoRaServer`).

---

On machine #**2** (Raspberry Pi or not), connected to an Arduino UNO with the
sketch `ArduinoRF95_RX` running on it, start the Arduino Server:
```
 $ ./runArduinoServer.sh
 Make sure you have uploaded the right sketch on the Arduino, and connected it through its USB cable.

This `forwarder` filters the `NMEA` sentences, it sends only the `RMC` ones.
As a result, they're received by the RF95 Server:

```
 Received [$GPRMC,161145.252,A,3720.1538,N,12143.0135,W,000.0,116.3,170617,,,A*77]

```
... this is where you could do something more interesting with them.

This could for example be a way to know where a remote vehicle is, and plot its position on a map.

> And to nail it down one more time, `NMEA` has been designed to convey sensor data.
