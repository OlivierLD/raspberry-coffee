Big upgrade to ES6 and its Promises (like in RESTNavServer)

# FIXED Stuff

### Reading 2 Serial ports
No problem, with a `yaml` like this:
```yaml
#
# MUX definition.
#
name: "Read 2 serial ports, generate one log file"
context:
  with.http.server: false
  http.port: 9999
  init.cache: false
channels:
  - type: serial
    port: /dev/ttyUSB0 
    baudrate: 4800
    # sentence.filters: ~RMC
    verbose: true
  - type: serial
    port: /dev/ttyS80
    baudrate: 4800
    # sentence.filters: RMC
    verbose: true
forwarders:
  - type: file
    filename: ./data.nmea
    flush: true
    verbose: false
    # forward.01.timebase.filename=true
    # forward.01.filename.suffix=_LOG
    # forward.01.log.dir=logged
    # forward.01.split=hour
```

### Several tentatives to open serial ports
Look where it says `/dev/ttyUSB0: No Such Port`, it seems to be related to the lock file that need to be created for exclusive access.
But if we insist, it will work eventually.

# TODO Stuff

## AIS & REST
- Connect an AIS receiver to a Raspberry
- Push AIS data to another Mux using REST Publisher (to `POST /mux/nmea-sentence`)
- See <https://github.com/OlivierLD/raspberry-coffee/tree/master/Project-Trunk/dAISy>

## Push to a Screen Server
- Using REST Forwarder, display some selected data on a TFT, OLED, or E-Ink
  - See in module `http-client-samples`, in the `src/main/python` folder.

## Clean the samples
- Move them to the module `NMEA-multiplexer-impl`.
