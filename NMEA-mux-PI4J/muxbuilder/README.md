# YAML Builder
The goal here is to build the `yaml` document defining the multiplexer, from a web page running in a browser.

Two versions are presented here:
- A "standard" HTML version, in the `text` folder.
- A Graphical Drag-and-Drop version, maybe more user-friendly, in the `dragndrop` folder. 

Both versions produce the exact same output.

It requires absolutely _NO_ external library, and can run in standalone (no server required).

The yaml is generated in the html page, it is intended to be copied into the final yaml document.
